Rails4-Blog
===========

This app is simple blog application that lets to create and publish articles. The first iteration focuses on the basics: creating and editing articles.
The idea isn’t to focus on the nitty-gritty, but instead to concentrate on the general case.
This application will have two kinds of users: those who post and publish articles and those who wish to comment on existing articles. In some cases, people will play both roles. Not all users will need to create an account by registering on the site. It will also be nice if people can notify their friends about interesting articles using a feature that sends a friendly e-mail notification to interested parties.
You will add some of these features in later chapters. Other application requirements will likely come up as
you continue, but these are enough to get started. In the real world, specifications are seldom correct the first time around, so it’s best not to dwell on them. Rails doesn’t penalize you for making changes to an application that’s under construction, so you can engage in an iterative style of development, adding and incrementing functionality as you go.
You start with what matters most: articles. You may wonder why you don’t begin with users. After all, without users, who will post the articles? If you think about it, without articles, what could users do? Articles are the epicenter of the application, so it makes the most sense to start there and work out the details as you go. Ready? Let’s get started!
